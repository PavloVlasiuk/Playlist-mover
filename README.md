# Playlists-mover
The Music Playlist Mover is a project that allows users to seamlessly transfer their playlists from YouTube Music to Spotify.  This project utilizes the Spotify API and Google API (for YouTube Music) and is built using JavaScript and Node.js for server-side development.

Features
Playlist Transfer: The main functionality of the project is to transfer playlists from YouTube Music to Spotify. Users can provide the URL of their YouTube Music playlist, and the application will retrieve the corresponding tracks and create a new playlist on Spotify.

Track Mapping: Since YouTube Music and Spotify may have different music catalogs, the application incorporates a track mapping mechanism. It attempts to find the closest match for each track in the YouTube Music playlist on Spotify.

User Interface: To enhance user experience, a user-friendly interface is provided.

Technologies Used
The Music Playlist Mover project utilizes the following technologies and APIs:

Spotify API: It enables the application to authenticate users, access their Spotify accounts, and create playlists on their behalf. The API also provides methods to search for tracks and add them to playlists.

Google API: The Google API, specifically the YouTube Data API, is used to retrieve playlist information, such as track titles, artists, and albums, from YouTube Music. This data is essential for mapping and transferring the playlists to Spotify.

JavaScript: The project is implemented using JavaScript, a widely-used programming language for web development.

Node.js: Node.js is a JavaScript runtime environment that allows server-side execution of JavaScript code.
